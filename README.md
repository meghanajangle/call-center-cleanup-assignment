# call-center-cleanup-assignment
Call Center Clean up - A company was looking to possibly hire five additional reps to enhance customer experience in one of its two (North and South) branches. 
Project requirement was to perform data cleaning and analysis to check how efficient the current reps are in each branch and determine which branch would benefit from additional assistances.

Following are the activities performed for this project.
1. Exploratory Data Analysis - No of reps per branch, calculated different measures like average busy minutes, not ready minutes, incoming wait time, during call wait time and no of calls taken for each time block(per hours) for each branch.
2. Data cleaning - Identified and analyzed missing values, outliers, unnecessary and duplicate values.
3. Data Manipulation - Grouped the data with different attributes. Manipulated the date to find the rep in each branch that had the highest number of calls, KPI for average call abandonment rate , Service level(percentage of calls answered within a specific number of seconds) and Average speed of answer.
4. Visualization - Created different visuals -  Line Chart, Horizontal Bar chart, Vertical Bar Chart and Donut Chart using matplotlib, seaborn and numpy for the KPIs created in the Data Manipulation.
